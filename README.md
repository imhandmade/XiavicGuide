## Ranks
---
There are two sets of ranks on the server.

Paid ranks and ranks earned by Voting.

All of the perks granted by paying for a rank are shared with its equivalent vote rank. Which means that if you put in the time, you can earn top teir perks.

**Each rank inherits the perks of previous ranks in the heirarchy**
